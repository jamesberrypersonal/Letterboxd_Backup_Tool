# Letterboxd Automated Local Backup Tool

Tool for locally backing up account data for [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com), a film-focussed social media site. Once set up, tool automatically scrapes your letterboxd account page at regular intervals to maintain an up to date backup of your account data locally. Data backed up includes list of watched films, along with rating, watch date, and review data when available, as well as any user-created lists. Allows for easy extracting of your film data from letterboxd, whether for backup purposes or for personal use.
