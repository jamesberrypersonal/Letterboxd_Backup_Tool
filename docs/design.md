Planning document for project feature design - **relevant to initial development period (pre v.1.0.0) only.**

## Structure

Overall structure of the project assumed to be as follows:

- Project consists of 4 general areas of development, and thus this design document will discuss each of these areas as seperate sections below. These areas consist of:
  1. [**Data Retrieval**](#data-retrieval)
  2. [**Automation of Backup**](#automation-of-backup)
  3. [**Data Storage**](#data-storage)
  4. [**User Interaction**](#user-interaction)
- Furthermore, at the end of this document ([here](#miscellaneous-considerations-and-further-work)) we will also consider miscellaneous considerations that do not fit in either of the above topics, as well as possible considerations for further post-release work to keep in mind during initial development.
